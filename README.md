# average-phonetic-name

Goal: The purpose of this experiment is to generate names which are comprised of the most common attributes of the most common names in the world.
First, the top 10 names from major regions constituting at least 95% of the human population will be collected 
Names will be broken down into syllables and translated into the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
They will then be given weights based on the percentage of the population of their region they represent, and what percentage of the total human population in turn that represents.

Syllable data will be given a number representing its position in the name.

Then, a name will be generated with statistically the most common number of syllables, using the syllables most prevalent in their respective positions.
